Synopsis

Will be a 2d topdown space shooter, which you can attach more parts to your ship (After you've blown them off enemy ships, of course)

Building
--------

You need two libraries, SDL2 and GLM
If they cannot be found in the standard search paths, edit the toplevel CMakeLists.txt to give it the locations

Requires Clang or GCC with C++ 14 features

SDL2 requires Mixer, Image, and TTF extensions to be installed also
